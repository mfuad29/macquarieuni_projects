Two major projects i have worked on

Womens community Shelter: the aim of this report is to develop and implement a method to measure the social impact of the Women’s Community Shelters. It will focus on analysing datasets of domestic violence and sexual assault amongst women who have engaged with the WCS. Through comparison of predicted and actual incidents, this report will outline a methodology that can help WCS assess their effectiveness and significance in society.

Justice For Women:  This project seeks to:
1. Streamline Access to Resources: Offer real-time advice on available services (e.g., crisis housing, counselling, legal aid) tailored to individual circumstances, addressing fragmented support systems highlighted by organisations like The Women’s Centre and Mission Australia.
2. Spread Information: Educate women on essential steps for safety and legal recourse, such as documenting abuse and understanding rights, empowering them with the available resources.
3. Encourage Legal Preparedness: Guide women in gathering evidence (medical records, witness statements) and navigating legal processes, showing them what the process may look like for them, and increasing the likelihood of their case being taken on pro bono.
Provide Targeted Support (Equal Opportunities): Use collected data to categorise cases efficiently, directing women to appropriate services while partnering with law firms to prioritise pro bono representation.
